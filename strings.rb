# In IRB calculate â€” 
#     1. How many hours are in a year.
#     2. How many minutes are in a decade?
#     3. How many seconds old are you?



# What do you think happens when you combine the following floats and integers?
# Is the result a float or an integer?
# Try computing these in irb â€”
#     1. 3.0 / 2
#     2. 3 / 2.0
#     3. 4 ** 2.0
#     4. 4.1 % 2
